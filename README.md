Labeled distribution learning is a new machine learning paradigm that transforms multiple labels into a distributed fashion.
However, the official dataset provided lacks the real distribution markers. For this purpose, we provide 600 sets of color images, each corresponding to 11 emotions, which have a distribution value sum of 1.

We employ 10 experts to mark each watercolor, and each image is considered a product, with each product including 11 emotions.
These 10 experts were 5 men and 5 women, evenly distributed in age from 20-60, eliminating a certain social impact.
For each watercolor, we consider it to be a product for the general public, so we define 11 emotions from the viewpoint of product design, each of which is known to the marker as a priori knowledge.
10 labeled tables were eventually averaged into one table.


We sincerely hope that you appreciate the efforts and work of IDAM Lab in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology in the acknowledgement section of the paper.
